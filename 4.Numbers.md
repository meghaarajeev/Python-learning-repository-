# 🔢Numbers in Python
Printing a number in python is very easy and you can do it in two ways.
<li> To print the number as it is.<br>
     eg: print(10)</li>
<li> To print it using a variable<br>
     eg: num = 79
     print(num)</li>
     
# ➗Arithematic operations
<li>Various arithematic operations can be performed in python like +,-,* and /.<br>
eg: print(78+22)<br>
    print(78+22.934)<br></li>
<li>In a similar fashion you can also use the '%' operator to find remainder of division.<br>
eg: print(20%3)</li>

# ⛓️Concatenation Rule
<li>Concatenation is python is only possible if the input is a string, For a number to be concatenated it should be first converted to a string or ',' operator should be used.<br>
eg: print('10, is a number)</li>
