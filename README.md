# Welcome to my Python Learning Repository!🎭
This repository contains basic codes and fundamentals of Python, which I discovered throughout my learning process. This is a go-to place for everything, I'm picking up along the way.

# 🐍What's Python?
Python is the fastest-growing programming language that is flexible easy to learn, read and use. Python can be used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

# 🔍Where should I start learning Python from?
The Python course I'm taking is [Python Backend Web Development Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBzwzrDvZ18) by [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp). You can also start off from there. It's completely free and the only thing required is your dedication💪🏿.
