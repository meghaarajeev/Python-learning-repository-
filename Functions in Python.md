# 👷🏿Function

  2. **.lower()** - Converts all the letters in a string to Lowercase.
  3. **.isupper()** - Checks if all letters are in uppercase.
  4. **.islower()** - Check if all letters are lowercase.
  5. **len()** - Calculates the length of the given string.
  6. **.index()** - Used to iterate through each string letter.
  7. **.replace()** - Used to replace a letter using another in a string.
  8. **abs()** - Prints the absolute of given integer.
  9. **max()** - Prints the maximum value from the input stream.
  10. **min()** -Prints the minimum value from the input stream
  11. **round()** - It is used round a decimal number and print the result.
  12. **bin()** - It prints the binary equivalent to the given input.
  13. **.swapcase()** - swaps upper case to lower and lower case to upper.
  14. **.capitalize()** -  returns a copy of the string with its first character in uppercase and the rest in lowercase.

  ```
  map(function,iterable)
  ```
  19. **filter()** - selects items from an iterable based on a function's condition.

# 💪🏼Lambda Functions

  Lambda Functions are anonymous functions. It can have any no of articles but only one expression.

All these functions can be used in python directly.But,there exist many other functions in python that requires importing in order to  use it on Python.

# 📲How to Import Functions?<br>
Refer the example given below that is used to find the squareroot of a number<br>
```
from math import *
print(sqrt(100))
```
